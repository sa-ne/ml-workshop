# Introduction to Jupyter 

[Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is an open source initiative to support interative data science and scientific computing across all programming languages. The Jupyter community is composed of several sub-communities and projects. For the purpose of this workshop we will focus in the user interface and some aspects of the available kernels.

## User Interfaces

The Jupyter user interfaces offer a foundation of interactive computing enironment where scientific computing, data science and analytics can be perfomed using a wide range of programming languages.

In order to understand a bit more of what interface options we have for Jupyter here are the follwing listed:

**Jupyter Notebook** - A web-based application for authoring documents that combine live-code with narrative text, equations and visualizations.

**Jupyter Console** - Terminal based console for interactive computing.

**Jupyter QtConsole** - Qt application for interactive computing with rich output.

## Kernels

Kernels are _programming language specific_ processes that run independently and interact with the Jupyter Applications and their interfaces. [IPython](https://ipython.org/) is the reference Jupyter kernel, providing a powerful environment for interactive computing in Python.

A full list of kernels can be found [here](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels). Many of these kernels are developed by third parties and may or may not be stable.
